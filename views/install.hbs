<h2>What's Eardogger?</h2>

<p>Eardogger is a bookmark service for long webcomics and web-books.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to sync bookmarks, but this one is weird because it's designed for <em>reading:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Only one bookmark per site.</strong> Eardogger assumes each page is just a temporary resting point in a larger work; when you read a little further on a site and then save your place again, it moves your old bookmark. It's like marking your place with a slip of paper instead of a color-coded sticky note.</li>
  <li><strong>Available everywhere.</strong> Pause your reading on one device, and resume elsewhere.</li>
  <li><strong>Incredibly lazy.</strong> If you've already bookmarked a site once, you can pause or resume with just one click.</li>
  <li><strong>Calls bookmarks "dogears"??</strong> I liked how sloppy and disreputable it sounded. üê∂</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use Eardogger</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Sign up for a free account.</li>
  <li>Install the "Mark my spot" and "Where was I" bookmarklets on all your devices and browsers.</li>
  <li>To pause what you're reading, click "Mark my spot."
    <ul>
      <li>If you've dogeared that site before, that's it! The dogear now marks your new position.</li>
      <li>If it's a new site, it'll ask you for a name and then create a new dogear. (You can also adjust the URL prefix, for sites that share a domain with several other sites.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To resume reading a site from where you paused it, use the list of dogears on the <a href="/">Eardogger homepage</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Or, if you're already on that site, click "Where was I." (Useful when you left a tab open but then read further on another device.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>How to Install the Bookmarklets</h2>

<p>Bookmarklets are like browser extensions, but more primitive. Behold:</p>

<div class="columns">
  <div>
    <h3>
      <a href="{{mark}}">Mark my spot</a>
    </h3>
    <textarea rows="3" cols="20" spellcheck="false">{{mark}}</textarea>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>
      <a href="{{where}}">Where was I</a>
    </h3>
    <textarea rows="3" cols="20" spellcheck="false">{{where}}</textarea>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Installation depends on your browser; basically, do whatever it takes to create a bookmark whose "location" field is that long nasty <code>javascript:</code> URL. Some notable approaches:</p>

<h3>In Most Desktop Browsers</h3>

<p>You usually want these on the toolbar so they're easily accessible, but you could also put them in the menu.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go into the "view" menu and make sure the "bookmark toolbar" is visible, or else open your browser's bookmark manager.</li>
<li>Drag the bookmarklet links and drop them where you want them.</li>
</ol>

<h3>On iOS Safari</h3>

<p>You usually want these at the top of the "favorites" section of your bookmarks. That way, you can activate them by tapping on the URL bar and then choosing from the set of big tiles. To install each bookmarklet:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, use the share menu to bookmark some random page, like this one. Put it in the "favorites" section.</li>
<li>Copy the <code>javascript:</code> URL to the clipboard. (On iOS ‚â• 13 you can tap-and-hold the links; on iOS ‚â§ 12 you have to copy from the textarea.)</li>
<li>Open your bookmarks and tap the "edit" button.</li>
<li>Tap the bookmark you just made. Rename it, and replace the current URL with the <code>javascript:</code> URL.</li>
</ol>
