<h2>What's Eardogger?</h2>

<p>Eardogger is a bookmark tool built for reading! It can save your place in webcomics, web-books, and other long Web Stuff.</p>

<p>Also it refers to bookmarks as "dogears," because I liked how sloppy and disreputable it sounded. üê∂</p>

<p>Unlike other bookmark tools, Eardogger assumes that a page is just a temporary resting point in a larger work; if you save your place again on the same site, it'll just <em>move</em> your dogear because the old location doesn't matter anymore. That means you can usually pause what you're reading with just one click.</p>

<h2>How to Use Eardogger</h2>

<ol>
  <li>On all your devices and browsers, install the "Mark my spot" and "Where was I" bookmarklets.</li>
  <li>To pause what you're reading, click "Mark my spot."
    <ul>
      <li>If it's a site you've dogeared before, that's it! The dogear now marks your new position.</li>
      <li>If it's a new site, it'll ask you for a name and then create a new dogear. (You can also adjust the URL prefix, for sites that share a domain with several other sites.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To resume reading a site from where you paused it, use the list of dogears on the <a href="/">Eardogger homepage</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Or, if you're already on that site, click "Where was I." (Useful when you left a tab open but then read further on another device.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>How to Install the Bookmarklets</h2>

<p>Bookmarklets are like browser extensions, but more primitive. Behold:</p>

<div class="columns">
  <div>
    <h3>
      <a href="{{mark}}">Mark my spot</a>
    </h3>
    <textarea rows="3" cols="20" spellcheck="false">{{mark}}</textarea>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>
      <a href="{{where}}">Where was I</a>
    </h3>
    <textarea rows="3" cols="20" spellcheck="false">{{where}}</textarea>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Installation depends on your browser; basically, do whatever it takes to create a bookmark whose "location" field is that long nasty <code>javascript:</code> URL. Some notable approaches:</p>

<h3>In Most Desktop Browsers</h3>

<p>You usually want these on the toolbar so they're easily accessible, but you could also put them in the menu.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go into the "view" menu and make sure the "bookmark toolbar" is visible, or else open your browser's bookmark manager.</li>
<li>Drag the bookmarklet links and drop them where you want them.</li>
</ol>

<h3>On iOS Safari</h3>

<p>You usually want these at the top of the "favorites" section of your bookmarks. That way, you can activate them by tapping on the URL bar and then choosing from the set of big tiles. To install each bookmarklet:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, use the share menu to bookmark some random page, like this one. Put it in the "favorites" section.</li>
<li>Copy the <code>javascript:</code> URL to the clipboard. (On iOS ‚â• 13 you can tap-and-hold the links; on iOS ‚â§ 12 you have to copy from the textarea.)</li>
<li>Open your bookmarks and tap the "edit" button.</li>
<li>Tap the bookmark you just made. Rename it, and replace the current URL with the <code>javascript:</code> URL.</li>
</ol>
