<h2>What Eardogger is For</h2>

<p>Most bookmark tools are for <em>researching and indexing:</em> mark a specific page, and that mark stays put until you delete it.</p>

<p>But Eardogger is for <em>reading,</em> and a reader's bookmark is constantly moving. So instead of saving isolated pages, Eardogger saves your <em>position within a larger work.</em> You get one bookmark ("dogear") per site, and when you mark a new location on that site, it just updates the existing bookmark.</p>

<p>The upshot is that it only takes <em>one click</em> to save your place in a thing you've been reading, which adds up if you're working your way through a long webcomic (or fanfic, or technical manual) over the course of several weeks.</p>

<h2>How to use Eardogger</h2>

<ol>
  <li>On all your devices and browsers, bookmark the Eardogger homepage and install the "Mark my spot" and "Where was I" bookmarklets.</li>
  <li>To pause what you're reading, click "Mark my spot."
    <ul>
      <li>If it's a site you've dogeared before, that's it! The dogear now marks your new position.</li>
      <li>If it's a new site, it'll ask you for a name and then create a new dogear. (You can also adjust the URL prefix, for sites that share a domain with several other sites.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To resume reading a site from where you paused it, either:
    <ul>
      <li>Use the list of dogears on the <a href="/">Eardogger homepage</a>.</li>
      <li>If you're already on that site, click "Where was I." (Useful when you left a tab open, but it's behind your current position because you read further on another device.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>The Bookmarklets</h2>

<div class="columns">
  <div>
    <h3>
      <a href="{{mark}}">Mark my spot</a>
    </h3>
    <textarea rows="3" cols="20" spellcheck="false">{{mark}}</textarea>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>
      <a href="{{where}}">Where was I</a>
    </h3>
    <textarea rows="3" cols="20" spellcheck="false">{{where}}</textarea>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>How to Install the Bookmarklets</h2>

<p>Bookmarklets are like browser extensions, but more primitive.</p>

<p>Installation depends on your browser; basically, do whatever it takes to create a bookmark whose "location" field is that long nasty <code>javascript:</code> URL. Some notable approaches:</p>

<h3>In Most Desktop Browsers</h3>

<p>You usually want these on the toolbar so they're easily accessible, but you could also put them in the menu.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go into the "view" menu and make sure the "bookmark toolbar" is visible, or else open your browser's bookmark manager.</li>
<li>Drag the bookmarklet links and drop them where you want them.</li>
</ol>

<h3>On iOS Safari</h3>

<p>You usually want these at the top of the "favorites" section of your bookmarks. That way, you can activate them by tapping on the URL bar and then choosing from the set of big tiles. To install each bookmarklet:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, use the share menu to bookmark some random page, like this one. Put it in the "favorites" section.</li>
<li>Copy the <code>javascript:</code> URL to the clipboard. (On iOS ≥ 13 you can tap-and-hold the links; on iOS ≤ 12 you have to copy from the textarea.)</li>
<li>Open your bookmarks and tap the "edit" button.</li>
<li>Tap the bookmark you just made. Rename it, and replace the current URL with the <code>javascript:</code> URL.</li>
</ol>
