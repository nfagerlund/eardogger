<h2>Install the Eardogger Bookmarklets</h2>

<p>Bookmarklets are like simple browser extensions: when you activate them, they perform an action on whatever page you're currently viewing. Eardogger uses two bookmarklets:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>"Mark my spot"</strong> ‚Äî¬†Self-explanatory.</li>
  <li><strong>"Where was I?"</strong> (optional) ‚Äî¬†Like a "load saved game" button. If you previously marked your spot on the site you're viewing, this jumps directly to your saved location.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your desktop and mobile browsers sync bookmarks with each other, you might only need to install these once; bookmarklets get synced just like regular bookmarks.</p>

<div class="columns">
  <div>
    <h3><a href="{{mark}}">Mark my spot</a></h3>

    <p><strong>Desktop:</strong> Bookmark that link ‚¨ÜÔ∏è</p>

<h2>Desktop Instructions</h2>

<p>Drag and drop the links above, or right-click the links and select "bookmark."</p>

<p>You usually want these on the "bookmark toolbar" or in the menu, so they're easily accessible.</p>

<h2>iOS Instructions (Safari)</h2>

<p>iOS doesn't want you to bookmark javascript URLs by accident, so it adds an extra step: you have to create a normal bookmark, then manually replace its URL. In more detail:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the share menu to bookmark <em>this</em> page. For easy access, put it in the "favorites" section.</li>
  <li>Copy the <code>javascript:</code> URL to the clipboard.</li>
  <li>Open your bookmarks and tap "edit".</li>
  <li>Edit the bookmark you just made. Rename it, and replace the current URL with the copied <code>javascript:</code> URL.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you put your bookmarklets in "favorites," the fastest way to activate them is to tap the URL bar; a list of icons will appear, and you can tap the icon for your bookmarklet. You can also activate bookmarklets from the main bookmarks sheet.</p>

<p>Other iOS browsers have their controls in different places, but still use the same "bookmark something random, then replace the name and URL" technique.</p>

<h2>Android Instructions (Chrome)</h2>

<p>Chrome on Android uses the same installation technique as iOS Safari:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bookmark <em>this</em> page by going to the "‚Ä¶" menu and tapping the star.</li>
  <li>Copy the <code>javascript:</code> URL to the clipboard.</li>
  <li>Open your bookmarks, find the bookmark you made, and edit it. Rename it, and replace the current URL with the copied <code>javascript:</code> URL.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, <em>activating</em> bookmarklets on Chrome is weird. You must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tap the location bar.</li>
  <li>Type part of the bookmarklet's name, so it appears in the list of suggestions.</li>
  <li>Tap the bookmarklet in the suggestions list.</li>
</ol>

<p>For some reason, Chrome <em>doesn't</em> let you activate bookmarklets by tapping them from the bookmarks list; only the location bar suggestions will work. Because of this, you might want to include a unique abbreviation in your bookmarklet names, so you don't have to type as much to make them appear in the suggestions list.</p>

<p>Other Android browsers might do their own things, but if you've gone to the trouble to install a non-default browser on your telephone in the first place, you can probably sort it out.</p>
