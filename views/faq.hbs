<h2>I'm Baby</h2>

<p>This thing is in a super 🐣~alpha~🐣 condition and it literally just launched, and it's probably not bug-free. Thank u for ur patience.</p>

<h2>There are no frequently asked questions...</h2>

<p>because this place hasn't existed long enough for any given question to have been asked "frequently."</p>

<h2>...but hmu</h2>

<p>If you're here in the first place you probably know me personally!! So just text me if you're curious about something or you run into a bug.</p>

<h2>Is this ~social~?</h2>

<p>This is absolutely 100% eternally not ~social~. Instead, I endorse texting your besties about the comic you've been enjoying. 🌻</p>

<h2>What is "elegance through stupidity?"</h2>

<p>A nebulous design quality that I admire and aspire to.</p>
