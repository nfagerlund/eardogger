<p>I am in fact pretty much Baby. This thing is in a super 🐣alpha🐣 condition and it is probably not bug-free. Thank u for ur patience.</p>

<h3>Is this ~social~?</h3>

<p>This is absolutely not ~social~. 🌻 I endorse texting your besties about what you're reading and/or avidly blogging that shit, but this website's highest ambition is to be a  💾 ｗｅｂ　ｓｃａｌｅ💽 version of the disintegrating receipt that's been marking your spot in <em>Ancillary Justice.</em></p>

<h3>What is "elegance through stupidity?"</h3>

<p>A nebulous design quality that I admire and aspire to.</p>
