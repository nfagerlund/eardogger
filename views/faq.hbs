<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Have any questions been frequently asked yet?</h3>

<p>Noootttttt really. I guess just text or @ me if you've got something.</p>

<h3>Can I save my place halfway through a page, or do I have to start at the top of a page?</h3>

<p>If there are clickable "anchors" within a long page, you can save your spot at one of those; you just need to click it before you save, so that the anchor is included in the URL that gets sent to Eardogger.</p>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch00-00-introduction.html">The Rust book</a> does this, if you want to see an example; all the headers are clickable anchors.</p>

<h3>Is this ~social~?</h3>

<p>This is absolutely not ~social~. 🌻 I endorse texting your besties about what you're reading and/or avidly blogging that shit, but this website's highest ambition is to be a  💾 ｗｅｂ　ｓｃａｌｅ💽 version of the disintegrating receipt that's been marking your spot in <em>Ancillary Justice.</em></p>

<h3>What is "elegance through stupidity?"</h3>

<p>A nebulous design quality that I admire and aspire to.</p>
