<h2 id="what-is">What's Eardogger?</h2>

<p>Eardogger is a bookmarking service for long webcomics and web-books.</p>

<p>There's lots of ways to bookmark a web page, but this one is weird because it's designed for <em>reading</em> (instead of <em>remembering</em> or <em>researching</em>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Only one bookmark per site.</strong> A marked page is just a temporary resting point in a larger work; when you read further and save your place again, Eardogger moves your old bookmark. In other words, it does "yesterday's bus ticket" bookmarks, not "six colors of sticky note" bookmarks.</li>
  <li><strong>Available everywhere.</strong> Pause your reading on one device, resume wherever.</li>
  <li><strong>Incredibly lazy.</strong> Pause or resume with one click on sites you've bookmarked before.</li>
  <li><strong>Calls bookmarks "dogears"??</strong> I liked how sloppy and disreputable it sounded. üê∂</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to">How to Use Eardogger</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Sign up for a free account.</li>
  <li><a href="/install">Install the "Mark my spot" and "Where was I" bookmarklets</a> on all your devices and browsers.</li>
  <li>To pause whatever you're reading, click "Mark my spot."
    <ul>
      <li>If you've dogeared that site before, that's it! The dogear now marks your new position.</li>
      <li>If this is a new site, Eardogger asks you for the site's name and makes a new dogear. (You can also adjust the URL prefix, for sites that share a domain with several other sites.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To resume reading a site from where you paused it, use the list of dogears on the <a href="/">Eardogger homepage</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Or, if you're already on that site, click "Where was I." (Good for when you left a tab open but then read further on another device.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>April 8, 2020</h3>

<p>
I taught Eardogger that "<code>www.</code>" is just decorative, so now it understands that <code>http://example.comic/34</code> and <code>http://www.example.comic/56</code> belong to the same site.
</p>

<p>
(Most sites accept both plain and "www" versions of their URLs, and then just redirect you to the owner's preferred format. But I ran into some sites that changed what their preferred format was at some point, which I wasn't expecting! Anyway, now people can do that without breaking your bookmarks.)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Addendum, April 19:</strong> Did the same thing for 2007-style "m-dot" mobile site subdomains. A few places (like Webtoons) still do this, even though it's completely heinous and annoying.

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Have any questions been frequently asked yet?</h3>

<p>Noootttttt really. I guess just text or @ me if you've got something.</p>

<h3>Can I save my place halfway through a page, or do I have to start at the top of a page?</h3>

<p>If there are clickable "anchors" within a long page, you can save your spot at one of those; you just need to click it before you save, so that the anchor is included in the URL that gets sent to Eardogger.</p>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch00-00-introduction.html">The Rust book</a> does this, if you want to see an example; all the headers are clickable anchors.</p>

<h3>Is this ~social~?</h3>

<p>This is absolutely not ~social~. üåª I endorse texting your besties about what you're reading and/or avidly blogging that shit, but this website's highest ambition is to be a  üíæ ÔΩóÔΩÖÔΩÇ„ÄÄÔΩìÔΩÉÔΩÅÔΩåÔΩÖüíΩ version of the disintegrating receipt that's been marking your spot in <em>Ancillary Justice.</em></p>

<h3>What is "elegance through stupidity?"</h3>

<p>A nebulous design quality that I admire and aspire to.</p>
